# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The point of the application is to provide exploratory analysis on  to create a variety of charts to create a summary of the ride-sharing by city type. The following summary will show how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used to to make strategic decisions at Py-Ber.  For the analysis, I used the following solutions to create a variety of charts to further enahance the analysis: 
* Pandas Lirary
* Matplotlib 
* Jupyter Notebook

## Results
The results of the analysis show some fairly distinct ups and downs in both the urban and Suburban city types.  Conversely, the fares in rural areas are more constant. 
Some interesting information was found during the analysis on totals per city type.  They are as follows:

**Total Rides:**
* Rural 135
* Urban 1625
* Sububan 625

**Total Drivers:**
* Ruran 537
* Urban 8570
* Suburban 59602

**Total Fares:**
* Rural $4327.93
* Urban $39854.38	
* Suburban $19356.33	

**Average Fare per ride**
* Rural $34.623440
* Urban $24.525772	
* Suburban $30.970128

**Average Fare per Driver:**
* Rural $8.059460
* Suburban $2.258615
* Urban $0.668675

**Total Fare by City Type:**
* Rural $4327.93	
* Suburban $19356.33	
* Urban $39854.38

## Summary
In summary, there are certaily some dissparities in the data.  First, average fare's per driver are much higher in rural areas than in urban areas but total fares in rural areas are much lower.  Additionally there are several less drivers in rural areas.  Adding additional drivers to these areas could be one way to add to the overall rides.
